<h1>Hi, I’m Shenai — it’s nice to have you here!</h1>
<p>
    I’m currently a rising junior at Carnegie Mellon University studying Electrical & Computer Engineering. I’m interested in creative technology, the arts, and pedagogy/outreach. 
    <br> <br>
    Some of my favorite projects include a set of generative plotted love letter poems, a collaboratively designed blind-accessible digital scale, and this website! I’ve also done research with CMU’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute and worked with the Center That Cares to design and teach a summer program to high schoolers in Pittsburgh's Hill District focused on creative engineering. I’m currently searching for a summer 2023 internship, so please get in touch if any of this sounds interesting to you!!
    <br> <br>
    I spend my days reading, cooking, being mediocre at yoga, and — if I’m in my hometown — petting my dog.
